## Welcome

A Journey of Learning and Collaboration.

Here, we will document our journey, set expectations and objectives, and provide a platform for communication between the internee and mentors.

The goal of this internship is to demonstrate how learning can be achieved in an open-source environment using GitHub. We aim to provide a hands-on experience for both mentors and mentees, and to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the project management community.

In this repository, you will find:

 - Detailed documentation of the internship program, including expectations, objectives, and desired outcomes.

 - Regular updates from the internee documenting their journey, challenges, and successes.

 - A platform for communication between the internee and mentors, including regular check-ins, feedback, and discussion forums.

 - A demonstration of how learning can be achieved in an open-source environment on GitHub, including presentations, case studies, and best practices.

Join us on this exciting journey of learning and collaboration as we explore the world of project management and the power of open-source collaboration!"
